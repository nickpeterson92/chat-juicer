## Story 1: Mapping Document

**As a** integration developer
**I want** to create a detailed mapping document for the [SOURCE_SYSTEM] to [TARGET_SYSTEM] integration
**So that** all stakeholders understand the data transformation requirements and field-level mappings

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Source system data structure documented (entities, fields, data types)
- [ ] Target system data structure documented (entities, fields, data types)
- [ ] Field-to-field mappings defined with transformation rules
- [ ] Data format conversions specified (dates, numbers, strings, etc.)
- [ ] Required vs optional fields identified
- [ ] Default values and null handling rules documented
- [ ] Business rules and conditional logic captured
- [ ] Mapping document reviewed and approved by [BUSINESS_OWNER]

### Definition of Done
- Mapping document stored in [DOCUMENT_REPOSITORY]
- Stakeholders have signed off
- Document includes version control and change log

---

## Story 2: Design Document

**As a** integration architect
**I want** to create a technical design document for the [SOURCE_SYSTEM] to [TARGET_SYSTEM] integration
**So that** the development team has a clear blueprint for implementation

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integration pattern selected (e.g., API, batch file, event-driven, etc.)
- [ ] Architecture diagram created showing system components and data flow
- [ ] Technology stack and tools identified
- [ ] Authentication and authorization approach defined
- [ ] Error handling strategy documented (retries, dead letter queues, alerts)
- [ ] Logging and monitoring requirements specified
- [ ] Data validation rules defined (schema validation, business rules)
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations identified (dev, test, prod)
- [ ] Dependencies and integration points mapped
- [ ] Design reviewed by [TECH_LEAD] and [ARCHITECT]

### Definition of Done
- Design document stored in [DOCUMENT_REPOSITORY]
- Technical stakeholders have approved
- Design aligns with enterprise architecture standards

## Story 3: Integration Build and Unit Testing

**As a** integration developer
**I want** to build and unit test the [SOURCE_SYSTEM] to [TARGET_SYSTEM] integration
**So that** individual components work correctly in isolation

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integration code implemented per design document
- [ ] Data transformations implemented per mapping document
- [ ] Authentication/authorization implemented
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic implemented
- [ ] Logging implemented
- [ ] Unit testing completed for all transformation logic
- [ ] Unit testing compelted for happy path scenarios
- [ ] Unit testing completed for error handling scenarios
- [ ] Mock data created for unit testing
- [ ] Code follows team coding standards and conventions
- [ ] Code reviewed by [PEER_REVIEWER]
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Configuration externalized for different environments

### Definition of Done
- Process is deployed to dev environment with meaningful deployment notes
- Unit test coverage meets team threshold
- No critical code quality issues identified

## Story 4: Integration E2E Testing

**As a** QA engineer
**I want** to perform end-to-end testing of the [SOURCE_SYSTEM] to [TARGET_SYSTEM] integration
**So that** the integration works correctly in a realistic environment

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test environment provisioned with [SOURCE_SYSTEM] and [TARGET_SYSTEM]
- [ ] Test data sets prepared covering:
  - [ ] Happy path scenarios
  - [ ] Edge cases (boundary values, special characters, etc.)
  - [ ] Error scenarios (invalid data, timeouts, system unavailability)
  - [ ] Volume/load scenarios (if applicable)
- [ ] E2E test cases executed and documented:
  - [ ] Data successfully flows from source to target
  - [ ] Field mappings verified in target system
  - [ ] Data transformations applied correctly
  - [ ] Business rules enforced properly
- [ ] Error handling validated:
  - [ ] Invalid data rejected appropriately
  - [ ] Error messages logged correctly
  - [ ] Retry logic functions as designed
  - [ ] Alerts triggered for critical failures
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (throughput, latency)
- [ ] Data reconciliation performed (source vs target record counts)
- [ ] Idempotency tested (if applicable)
- [ ] All defects logged and resolved or accepted
- [ ] Test results documented and reviewed with [PRODUCT_OWNER]

### Definition of Done
- All test cases executed with pass/fail status documented
- Critical and high-priority defects resolved
- Low-priority defects are resolved or backlogged (depends on priority:LOE ratio)
- Test evidence captured (screenshots, logs, reports)
- Sign-off obtained from [QA_LEAD] and [BUSINESS_OWNER]
- Integration ready for production deployment
