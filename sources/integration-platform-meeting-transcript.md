## Meeting Transcript

**Alex Rodriguez:** Good morning everyone. Today we're here to discuss the platform selection for your Salesforce to NetSuite integration project, specifically focusing on the sales order synchronization requirements you've outlined.

**Sarah Chen:** That's right. We need a robust solution that can handle real-time sales order flows from Salesforce to NetSuite, with order status updates flowing back. We're processing about 5,000 orders daily with seasonal spikes up to 15,000.

**Marcus Williams:** And we need something our team can maintain. We have good technical people, but they're not all developers.

**Jordan Kim:** Based on your requirements, we've evaluated three leading platforms: Boomi, MuleSoft, and Workato. Let me walk through each option.

### MuleSoft Discussion

**Jordan Kim:** MuleSoft is incredibly powerful. It's the Salesforce-owned solution, so the Salesforce connector is absolutely best-in-class. Full API-led connectivity approach.

**Sarah Chen:** What about the learning curve?

**Alex Rodriguez:** That's actually MuleSoft's main challenge for your use case. It requires significant development expertise. You'd need certified MuleSoft developers, and the Anypoint Platform, while powerful, has a steep learning curve.

**Marcus Williams:** What about costs?

**Jordan Kim:** MuleSoft is the premium option. You're looking at roughly $80,000 annually for your transaction volumes, plus implementation costs around $200,000-$300,000.

**Sarah Chen:** That's... substantial. What about time to market?

**Alex Rodriguez:** Typically 4-6 months for a properly architected MuleSoft implementation of this scope.

### Workato Discussion

**Jordan Kim:** Now, Workato is on the opposite end of the spectrum. It's a low-code/no-code platform, very user-friendly. Your business analysts could build integrations.

**Marcus Williams:** That sounds appealing for maintenance.

**Alex Rodriguez:** It is, but there are trade-offs. Workato can handle your current volumes, but those seasonal spikes to 15,000 orders might stress the platform. It's recipe-based, which is great for simple workflows but can become unwieldy for complex transformations.

**Sarah Chen:** We have some pretty complex order structures with custom objects in Salesforce.

**Jordan Kim:** That's a concern. Workato handles standard objects well, but complex custom object relationships and large-scale data transformations aren't its sweet spot. Also, error handling and monitoring capabilities are more basic compared to enterprise platforms.

**Marcus Williams:** Price point?

**Alex Rodriguez:** Much more affordable - around $30,000-$40,000 annually for your needs. Implementation would be faster too, maybe 6-8 weeks.

**Sarah Chen:** But it sounds like we might outgrow it quickly.

### Boomi Discussion

**Jordan Kim:** This brings us to Boomi. It sits perfectly in the middle - it's a low-code platform but with enterprise capabilities. Dell has really invested in making it robust.

**Marcus Williams:** Tell us more about the technical capabilities.

**Jordan Kim:** Boomi AtomSphere can definitely handle your volumes - 15,000 orders is well within its comfort zone. It has pre-built connectors for both Salesforce and NetSuite that are mature and well-maintained. The platform uses a visual drag-and-drop interface for building integrations, but also allows custom scripting when needed.

**Sarah Chen:** What about our complex data transformations?

**Alex Rodriguez:** Boomi's data mapping and transformation tools are excellent. The platform handles complex hierarchical data structures well, and you can build reusable components. Your team could maintain it after proper training - it doesn't require dedicated Boomi developers like MuleSoft would.

**Marcus Williams:** Error handling and monitoring?

**Jordan Kim:** Comprehensive. Real-time monitoring dashboards, automated error notifications, and built-in retry logic. You can set up custom alerts for business-critical issues. Plus, Boomi has process reporting that gives you visibility into order flow performance.

**Sarah Chen:** Deployment and scaling?

**Alex Rodriguez:** Very flexible. Boomi Atoms can be deployed on-premise, in your private cloud, or use Boomi's cloud. You can scale horizontally by adding Atoms as your volume grows. No infrastructure management needed if you use their cloud.

**Marcus Williams:** This sounds like it fits our needs. What about pricing and timeline?

**Jordan Kim:** Pricing is middle-ground - approximately $50,000-$60,000 annually for your transaction volumes. Implementation would take about 10-12 weeks for a production-ready solution with proper testing.

### Decision Discussion

**Sarah Chen:** Let me summarize what I'm hearing. MuleSoft is overpowered and over-budget for our needs. Workato might be too simple and we'd risk outgrowing it. Boomi seems to hit the sweet spot?

**Marcus Williams:** I agree. The ability for our team to maintain it is crucial. We don't want to be dependent on specialized developers for every change.

**Alex Rodriguez:** That's a key point. With Boomi, after initial training, your team can handle routine maintenance and even build new integrations. We typically see 70% reduction in dependency on external consultants compared to MuleSoft.

**Jordan Kim:** Also consider future integrations. You mentioned potentially connecting your WMS and CRM systems next year. Boomi's unified platform means you can reuse components and maintain everything in one place.

**Sarah Chen:** What about Salesforce's potential concerns since we're not using MuleSoft?

**Alex Rodriguez:** Salesforce is partner-friendly. Boomi is a certified Salesforce ISV partner. The connectors are fully supported, and honestly, for sales order integration, Boomi's pre-built accelerators might get you to production faster than building from scratch in MuleSoft.

**Marcus Williams:** Support and community?

**Jordan Kim:** Boomi has excellent support tiers and a very active community. The Boomiverse community portal has thousands of pre-built components you can leverage. Dell's backing also means long-term stability.

**Sarah Chen:** I think we have a decision. Boomi gives us the enterprise capabilities we need, at a reasonable price point, with the maintainability our team requires.

**Marcus Williams:** Agreed. The 10-12 week timeline also works with our Q1 launch target.

**Alex Rodriguez:** Excellent choice. Boomi's sweet spot is exactly your use case - complex enterprise integrations that need to be maintainable by in-house teams. Should we discuss next steps for the implementation?

**Sarah Chen:** Yes, let's move forward with Boomi. Can you prepare a detailed implementation plan and architecture design document?

**Jordan Kim:** Absolutely. We'll prepare a design document that covers the technical architecture, data flow mappings, error handling strategies, and deployment approach.
