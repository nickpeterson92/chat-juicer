# Salesforce to NetSuite Integration Requirements
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Author:** Marcus Williams, IT Director  
**Status:** Draft for Vendor Review

## Executive Summary
We need to integrate our Salesforce CRM with NetSuite ERP to automate the order management process. Currently, our sales team manually enters orders from Salesforce into NetSuite, which is time-consuming and error-prone. We estimate this integration will save 20 hours per week and eliminate data entry errors.

## Business Objectives
- Eliminate manual order entry between systems
- Provide real-time order status visibility to sales team
- Reduce order processing time from 24 hours to less than 1 hour
- Improve customer satisfaction with faster order confirmations

## Functional Requirements

### Order Flow
1. Sales team creates orders in Salesforce after opportunity closes
2. Order should automatically flow to NetSuite
3. NetSuite processes the order and sends back the order number
4. Order status updates should sync back to Salesforce
5. Sales team can see current order status in Salesforce

### Data to Sync
- Customer information (already synced nightly - working fine)
- Order header details (date, customer, totals)
- Order line items (products, quantities, prices)
- Order status (confirmed, shipped, invoiced)

### Volume Expectations
- Average: 5,000 orders per day
- Peak periods: Up to 15,000 orders per day (end of quarter)
- Most orders have 3-5 line items

## Technical Requirements

### Systems
- **Salesforce**: Enterprise Edition (current version)
- **NetSuite**: 2024.2 (recently upgraded)

### Integration Approach
- Real-time integration preferred
- REST APIs where available
- Prefer low-code solution for easier maintenance

### Security
- Use service accounts for system-to-system authentication
- Data should be encrypted in transit
- Follow company security policies

### Error Handling
- Email notifications for failures
- Ability to reprocess failed orders
- Daily reconciliation report

## Success Criteria
- 99.9% uptime for integration
- Less than 5 minute delay for order sync
- Zero data loss
- Automated error recovery

## Timeline
- **Project Start**: September 15, 2025
- **Development**: 4 weeks
- **Testing**: 2 weeks
- **Go-Live**: November 1, 2025

## Budget
- Approved budget: $150,000
- Includes software, implementation, and first year support

## Assumptions
1. Both systems have standard APIs available
2. Product master data is already synchronized
3. Customer data sync is working and will continue to work
4. No custom fields or complex business logic required
5. Standard NetSuite order processing workflow will be used

## Out of Scope
- Historical data migration (orders before go-live)
- Custom reporting
- Mobile application changes
- Modifications to standard NetSuite workflows

## Stakeholders
- **Sponsor**: Sarah Chen, CTO
- **Business Owner**: David Park, Sales Operations
- **Technical Lead**: Marcus Williams, IT Director
- **Key Users**: Sales Team, Finance Team

## Risks
- End of quarter volume spikes may stress the system
- Sales team adoption if system is too complex
- Potential API rate limits

## Dependencies
- NetSuite API documentation access
- Salesforce administrator availability
- Test environments for both systems

## Next Steps
1. Vendor selection for integration platform
2. Technical workshop to review requirements
3. Statement of Work development
4. Project kickoff
